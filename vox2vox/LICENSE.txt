Since there are currently no open-sourced PyTorch implementations of Vox2Vox at
the time of this blog post, I decided to take a stab at it. The full network
implementation can be found at my github repo. It is also linked to
PapersWithCode in order to gain more exposure and feedbacks. Please feel free to
fork, modify my code and even submit bug fixes as long as you give me credit.
